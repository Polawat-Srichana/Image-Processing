# Image-Processing
This report is the Assignment of
COMP3010 machine learning, which involves
studying and analyzing classifying images by
examining the quality of each method of
prediction and the quality of each model with
different architecture after the task is done, it
requires good analysis and conclusions, and
therefore this report shows the results of each
model and the conclusions obtained.
